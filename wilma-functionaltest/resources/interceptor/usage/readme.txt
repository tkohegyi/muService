The easiest way of compilation:
- put java file to modules/wilma-stub-configuration-domain/src/main/java
- compile by using IntelliJ
- move src and compiled class to here

Don't forget to remove all similar java and compiled class files from Wilma code,
otherwise in case you build you own Wilma,
the class will be "hardcoded" -> no chance to upload another version of the class to the running Wilma.
